The content, style, and interactive logic are separated into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, respectively. A design principle in modern programming is separation of concerns. Among the many reasons to separate concerns, two are simplicity and reuse. For example, by styling HTML elements using CSS, you can simplify your HTML code. Instead of coding the appearance within each element, you apply CSS styles to all the elements on a page, regardless of the page complexity. In addition, you can link multiple HTML pages to a single CSS file, which can help simplify a consistent look and feel across your entire website.
